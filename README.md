# Advent Of Code
My personal repository for the yearly [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) event.

## Compiling
These are the commands to use for each language:
```
jai day_1.jai
odin build day_1.odin -file
```

## Running
The input is not built into the executables, just feed it a file as a commandline argument.
```
day_1.exe input_1.txt
```

## Language info
* Jai: The jai compiler is currently in private beta, it is not publicly available. The main developer behind the language and compiler is [Jonathan Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow). To learn more about the language, [check out this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV5I2fxaiCKfxMBrNsU1kgKJXD3PkyxO) on his YouTube channel.
